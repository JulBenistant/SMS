function [rt, k, t0, t] = WaitAnyPress(keys, timeout, newOnly)
% WaitAnyPress - Wait for a button or a key press
%
%   [rt, k, t0, t] = WaitAnyPress(keys, timeout, newOnly)
%
%INPUTS:
%   keys: code of keys to listen to. Keyboard keys are mapped on 8:256.
%         By default, mouse clicks (which are mapped on 1=Left, 2=Right,
%         3=??, 4=Middle, 5=Backward, 6=Forward) are not listened. Parallel
%         port is read with ReadParPort(), if available. Bits are assigned
%         to the keycodes [257:264] so that:
%               1 (bit0) = 257 (left LENA-button)
%               2 (bit1) = 258 (middle LENA-button)
%               4 (bit2) = 259 (right LENA-button)
%                   ... 
%               128 (bit7) = 264
%   timeout: Duration of the timeout in seconds.
%   newOnly: only detect new keypress (not keys that were already pressed from
%            the onset)
%OUPUTS:
%   rt: reaction time (NaN if no key was pressed before timeout)
%   k : array with 1's for the button/key which have been pressed
%   t0: start time of the wait
%   t : real time of the press, so that rt = t - t0
